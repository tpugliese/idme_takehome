    "## Question 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the table design above, what are your initial thoughts about DogDB’s data tracking? What are some of the advantages (if any) of their data models, and what are the shortcomings (if any) you foresee in DogDB’s future?"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "id": "b6c355cb",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "The current model of DogDB does an adequate job of capturing the basic needs for the organization to determine who their customers are, how their interactions are managed and which accounts have an attributed license.  There is an `account_id` featured in each table for simple joins between the data for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "However there exist several deficiencies I see as the Analytics Engineer responsible for managing the health of the ecosystem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Issues with Primary Keys** Primary Keys are lacking on the `Customer Interactions` and `Customer Licenses` tables.  This is integral to the cardinality of these tables.  Without a unique identifier in these tables, you could end up with duplicate entries, which could throw off analytic aggregations and counts.  Modern SQL platforms also include optimizations for query indexing on Primary keys that could improve the speed of joins and aggregations on the tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Issues with Data Types** The `Customer Licenses` table's key information is formatted in a JSON blob, which is notoriously difficult for SQL to parse and access.  In this blob are key indicators, such as the licenses' status, and a `license_id` which could provide uniqueness to the table.  This is important for the business to understand _which customers have active or multiple licenses_ for functionality, billing and access to services. The noted field here of `status` with differing sets of `roles` implies functionality of the licenses which could have security, privacy or access vulnerabilities to the application.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Issues with `account_id`** With the implication of desired scalability, the important identifier of `account_id` is a numerical integer which presumably increases with each entry.  For a fast scaling organization, this is a short-sighted choice.  Key identifiers such as `account_id` should exist in an alphanumeric format that can be auto-incremented or prepared the column to be generated as the column's identity such as [this PostgreSQL exmaple](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-tutorial/postgresql-identity-column/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Tables with Conflicting Purposes** In schema design, it's easy to create tables that can focus on solving multiple issues.  Here the `Customer Accounts` table attempts to manage the Customer uniqueness _and_ the pricing structure for that customer.  Pricing plans are an important distinguisher of customer status, and as such deserve their own table.  What if pricing needs to change in the future?  What if a customer wishes to upgrade or purchase new services?  These questions reveal the need for payment terms to be their own table rather than tied to the `Customer Accounts` table.  Similarly the `Customer Interactions` table should singularly manage the interactions with Customers while allowing service representatives to have their own table.  This allows more information to be collected on a per ticket basis, while also allowing more information related to the service representative to exist elsewhere.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall I believe the current structure of these tables could lead to inaccurate counts and analytics while also overlaoding tables with unrelated information.  This is a parallel issue to not being equipped to scale.  In the given example, scaling is an important factor for this data model, so efforts should be taken to ensure the key tables have room to breathe while also maintaining clear delination of responsibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, I've utilized PostgreSQL to create new tables as I see their needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `customer_accounts_new` now is entirely focused on Customer data\n",
    "* `customer_pricing_plans` houses the Customer pricing plans with a numerical `monthly_charge` column to reflect prices in the prompt\n",
    "* `customer_interactions_new` has its own Primary Key and allows Serivce reps to be in their own table\n",
    "* `service_representatives` exists to track support agents that could leave the org or need more detail\n",
    "* `customer_licenses_new` gains the most from breaking out the JSON data into their own columns, restoring its uniqueness with the `license_id` now becoming its primary key"
