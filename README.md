# Takehome Assignment for ID.me

## Overview

This assignment was given in a PDF with three sample tables and five longform questions about a fictional company, DogDB.  In an effort to thoroughly and professionally answer these questions, I strove to create an accessable and visible response in the form of this Github Repo.

The other benefit of utilizing GitHub as a publishing platform is that it allows me to display and showcase my work in the future to other prospective employers or other interviewees for this position of Analytics Engineer.
