# Takehome Assignment for ID.me

## Overview

This assignment was given in a PDF with three sample tables and five longform questions about a fictional company, DogDB.  In an effort to thoroughly and professionally answer these questions, I strove to create an accessable and visible response in the form of this Github Repo.

The other benefit of utilizing GitHub as a publishing platform is that it allows me to display and showcase my work in the future to other prospective employers or other interviewees for this position of Analytics Engineer.


## Assignment Response

The work requested for the assignment can be found in the Notebook folder named `Technical Takehome.ipynb`.  I used Jupyter Notebook to provide a clean and interactive way to demonstrate my work, I explain further below in the **Resources Utilized** section of this document.

Inside this Notebook are my answers to the five questions proposed by the assignment and answered to the best of my ability in a reasonable timeframe.  While not all encompassing, I try to be straightforward, detailed and thorough in my resopnses.  The notebook can be downloaded and used in Jupyter Cloud or viewed on Github directly.


## Repository Structure

### Credentials

Here is where the config file for the local PostgreSQL instance is located.  I opted to obfuscate the password and credentials in the Technical Takehome notebook for privacy reasons, but display the file here.  I believe it is important to treat this project like a repository that could be downloaded and utilized by a team member, who could put their own credentials in the file and follow the process.

### Notebook

Here is where the Technical Takehome Notebook is located, which is the main file created to demonstrate the work and response of the assignment.  This also includes a Personal Assesment Notebook that is meant to be my opinion of the assignment and recount of the work involved.

### SQL Scripts

This is meant to house the PostgreSQL script that creates the schema and tables utilized in this example.  I hope at a baseline this can serve as an example of my SQL knowledge and possibly used in the future if this assignment continues to be provided in such a manner.  


## Resources Utilized

In creating this response, I utilized [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) for local python package maintenance, [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) for visualizing Python, SQL and Markdown code in an interactive manner, and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for maintaining a local copy of the sample tables from the prompt.

In the Notebook, I import the [sqlalchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and [psycopg2](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/) python packages, and their dependencies as managed by the aforementioned Anaconda package manager.

For troubleshooting, I followed Nihal Sahan's guide on [PostgreSQL in Jupyter](https://github.com/nihalsahan/DB/blob/main/ConnectPostgres.ipynb) I found through Google.
