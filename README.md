# Takehome Assignment for ID.me

## Overview

The given assignment was sent in a PDF with three sample tables and five long-form questions about a fictional company, DogDB.  To thoroughly and professionally answer these questions, I strove to create an accessible and visible response with a Github Repo.

The other benefit of utilizing GitHub as a publishing platform is that it allows me to display and showcase my work in the future to other prospective employers or other interviewees for this position of Analytics Engineer.


## Assignment Response

The requested work can be found in the Notebook folder named `Technical Takehome.ipynb`.  I used Jupyter Notebook to provide a clean and interactive way to demonstrate my work. 

Inside this Notebook folder are my answers to the five questions proposed by the assignment and answered to the best of my ability in a reasonable timeframe.  While not all-encompassing, I try to be straightforward, detailed, and thorough in my responses.  The notebook can be downloaded and used in Jupyter Cloud or viewed on GitHub directly.


## Repository Structure

### Credentials

Here is where the `config.yml` file for the local PostgreSQL instance is located.  I opted to obfuscate the password and credentials in the third cell of the Technical Takehome notebook for privacy reasons but display the config file here.  I believe it is important to treat this project like a repository that could be downloaded and utilized by a team member, who could put their credentials in the file and follow the process.  In Databases, dbt and other technical configurations, configuration or credential files are integral to environment connections.

### Notebook

Here is where the Technical Takehome Notebook is located, which is the main file created to demonstrate the work and response of the assignment.  The assignment is broken down into the initial **Instructions** and continues in the **Questions** sections.  The answer cells are my work.  

This folder also includes a Personal Assessment Notebook that is meant to be my opinion of the assignment and recount of the work involved.

### SQL Scripts

This folder houses the PostgreSQL script that creates the schema and tables utilized in this example.  I hope at a baseline this can serve as an example of my SQL knowledge and possibly be used in the future if this assignment continues to be provided in such a manner.  


## Resources Utilized

In creating this response, I utilized [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) for local Python package maintenance, [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) for visualizing Python, SQL, and Markdown code interactively, and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for maintaining a local copy of the sample tables from the prompt.

In the Notebook, I import the [sqlalchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and [psycopg2](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/) python packages, and their dependencies as managed by the aforementioned Anaconda package manager.

For troubleshooting, I followed Nihal Sahan's guide on [PostgreSQL in Jupyter](https://github.com/nihalsahan/DB/blob/main/ConnectPostgres.ipynb) I found through Google.

For the Config File obfuscating, I followed [Vicki Boykis' Guide](https://vickiboykis.com/2020/02/25/securely-storing-configuration-credentials-in-a-jupyter-notebook/) and chose YAML because it is prolific with dbt.
